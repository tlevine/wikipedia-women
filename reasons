I asked Mako on this 
http://suegardner.org/2011/02/19/nine-reasons-why-women-dont-edit-wikipedia-in-their-own-words/

1) Some women don’t edit Wikipedia because the editing interface isn’t sufficiently user-friendly.

* Studies on college students
  * Internet skills, &c.
* Aaron Shaw
* Ester Hargetai
* Information, Communication, Society

2) Some women don’t edit Wikipedia because they are too busy.

* Doesn't know of much
* Mako has some on competition between wikis
* Haiyi Zhu

3) Some women don’t edit Wikipedia because they aren’t sufficiently self-confident, and editing Wikipedia requires a lot of self-confidence.

* There's a theory from social psychology about women and self-confidence
* Doesn't know of any research related to Wikipedia

4) Some women don’t edit Wikipedia because they are conflict-averse and don’t like Wikipedia’s sometimes-fighty culture.

* There's some work on conflict in Wikipedia
* Collier & Bear
  * Conflict, Criticism, or Confidence
  * CCW 2012

5) Some women don’t edit Wikipedia because the information they bring to Wikipedia is too likely to be reverted or deleted.

* 

6) Some women don’t edit Wikipedia because they find its overall atmosphere misogynist.

* There are interview-type studies that cite this.
* A problem with many studies is that you can only study people who are
    contributing rather than people who aren't contributing.
  * It's not clear that these reasons are the same between people who contribute and those who don't
  * People don't study the people who aren't contributing at all.
* Hmm look for people who stopped contributing?
  * There was one. Maybe Bear and Collier
  * If not, Mako has one on survey estimation in interrnet surveys.
    * The gender gap revisited estimating propensity matching blah blah


7) Some women find Wikipedia culture to be sexual in ways they find off-putting.

* Is it sexual?
* Do women find that off-putting?

8) Some women whose primary language has grammatical gender find being addressed by Wikipedia as male off-putting.

* Never seen anything on it

9) Some women don’t edit Wikipedia because social relationships and a welcoming tone are important to them, and Wikipedia offers fewer opportunities for that than other sites.

* There has been a lot of research on trying to make Wikipedia have a more welcoming tone.
* He doesn't know whether they've done it in terms of gender.
* Jonathan Morgan, near Seattle, has done a lot related to this
  * Tools to make Wikipedia more welcoming and friendly.
  * Maybe hasn't tried to se ewhether that's the case
