Some methodology ideas

# Counterfactuals

## Translation experiment
Select several articles that are written in one language and not in
another. Translate the first few sentences to the other language, and
create a new article for that, citing the article in the first language.

Randomly decide whether to post the new article as one of many
identities. The simplest experiment would involve a male identity and
a female identity with otherwise similar traits.

Compare whatever outcome I like between the two authors.

* How quickly or whether the article is
  * Improved
  * Deleted
  * Marked with a particular template
* How people communicate with the author

## Compare different articles
For some hypothesis, I may be able to categorize articles into categories
that are worth comparing. For example, I could rate how misogynist, fighty,
or welcoming the talk page of the articles are.

This is less compelling to me than the other proposals in the present
writing unless I can easily demonstrate that the categories are otherwise
equivalent.

## Regression discontinuity
Identify precise times at which a relevant thing about the article
changed, and compare something in between. Some ideas

* A fight breaks out on the talk page.
* A particular editor begins editing.
    (for example, an editor involved in a fight)
* Article gets popular.
* Article gets tagged in a way that makes new people see it.
* Particular editors stop editing.

## Changes within an editor
Compare edits that a particular user made at different times. For example,
it may be that the users edit less after being involved in a sexual
discussion and that the reduction in edits is greater for women (reason 7).

# Ways of guessing/defining gender
I suspect that it will be hard to compare genders because it will be
hard to determine genders. I'd rather avoid determining genders, but
here are some ideas of how I might determine genders if I really need to.

These can be thought of as ways of guessing the gender of a user.

* Whether a username looks male or female
* Grammar and preferred prepositions
  * I read an awesome thing about how bloggers of different genders used
      words like "with" and "as" differently, and I tried using the female
      words on the internet, and it worked! This was like eight years ago
      (around 2006), and I can't find the original thing.
  * I'd want to validate it specifically for Wikipedia, and that might be hard.

It's better to think of the following approaches as definitions of gender
rather than as ways of guessing the gender of a user.

* Gender of the subject of an article
* Genders of the subjects of articles that a user has edited
* Genders of the subjects of articles that a user lists in a user page
