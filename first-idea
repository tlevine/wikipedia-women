This one gives me so many ideas!

For example, in order to test this reason,

> 4) Some women don’t edit Wikipedia because they are conflict-averse and
> don’t like Wikipedia’s sometimes-fighty culture.

we can guess whether each user is male or female and look for fightiness
in talk pages and revision histories. Then we can see whether the gender
balance of editors changes when the article gets fighty.

And in order to test this one,

> 5) Some women don’t edit Wikipedia because the information they bring to
> Wikipedia is too likely to be reverted or deleted.

we guess whether each user is male or female and see whether females'
edits are more likely to be reverted or deleted.

Guessing whether a user is male or female might be hard, so we might
instead look at edits to articles about people and see whether gender
of the article subject is associated with whether edits to the article
get reverted/deleted.
